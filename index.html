        <h2 class="homepageTextboxTwo">My Mantra is “Keep Moving Forward.” No matter what knowledge I’ve gained, 
          there is always more to learn and to improve on, 
          and it especially rings true in this field. UX/UI constantly is evolving and so I keep myself busy to keep growing with it. </h2>
