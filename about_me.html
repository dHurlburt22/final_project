        <h1  class="aboutInfoTextTop">Kota here, when I'm not actively working or going to college
            you can find me in way too many hobbies for my own good, some of which are listed below.
        </h1>

    <article class="aboutImageLineOne">
            <h2 class="aboutInfoTextOne">My first, and overall main hobby is video editing. The types of videos I make include
                gaming sessions I have with me and my friends, video essays I put together about various topics of interest I want 
                to take a deeper dive into, and sometimes little smaller edits where I take audio and splice over it with memes or 
                jokes that I've seen online or on social media that I can put into a quick video after I get
                off from work. Besides working in UX, I would say that video editing is where my main passion in life lies and I love
                getting to make videos surrounding fun activities such as video gaming.

        <img class="aboutSecondImage" alt="Picture of a me holding a pipe cleaner sword I was creating that is from the video game
        Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance" 
            src="images/PipeCleanerSword.png">

            <h3 class="aboutInfoTextTwo">My second big hobby is pipe cleaner art. I love making little creations out of pipe cleaners 
                as it's a good way to destress from hard and confusing homework/occupational work I have to do. 
                I've made many characters from TV shows like from Spongebob including the namesake himself, Squidward, and even a Krabby Patty! 
                I also make wreaths to hang out on my door for each season to spruce up my apartment. I also make little creatures like bees, 
                butterflies, and even little roses (who my lovely girlfriend is amassing a collection of).
                Also, the picture of the sword is Ragnell from the video game Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, it is one of my favorite games
                of all time!

    <article class="aboutImageLineThree">
            <h4 class="aboutInfoTextThree">My final hobby that I try to balance is cosplay, or basically character costume creation. 
                It is one of the harder hobbies I've undertaken as sewing can be a large undertaking, but 
                it has been fun to try (and many times fail) at learning how to make outfits only
                from sewing patterns. The patterns can be pretty difficult as they assume you understand some basic sewing techniques, so having
                Youtube to help me out when I'm stuck is very essential.But, the more fun part to me is 
                getting to work with foam, heat guns, and copious amounts of powerful glue
                to get an outfit all together for conventions. Which, getting to make someones day by being their favorite character
                makes all those barely sleeped nights worth it!
